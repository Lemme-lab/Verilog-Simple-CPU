# **Simple CPU in Verilog**

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **Simple CPU** designed entirely in Verilog, starting from the most fundamental NAND gates and building up to a complete CPU. The design is available in both **8-bit** and **16-bit** architectures, showcasing how different lane widths affect CPU complexity and functionality. The project is inspired by the [TinyTapeout](https://tinytapeout.com/) initiative, which allows creators to design their own digital circuits and have them fabricated in real silicon.

## Features

- **Built from NAND gates**: The CPU is constructed using basic logic gates, illustrating how complex systems can emerge from simple components.
- **8-bit and 16-bit versions**: Both versions share the same architecture, with variations in bit width and processing capabilities.
- **Fully designed in Verilog**: Implemented entirely in Verilog, making it accessible and understandable for those familiar with hardware description languages.
- **Tested on TinyTapeout**: The designs are tested using the TinyTapeout platform, which allows for real-world silicon fabrication.

## CPU Architecture

### Common Architecture for 8-bit and 16-bit CPUs

Both CPUs have the same architecture but differ in the bit-width of their data paths, registers, and instruction sets. Here's a summary of the architecture:

- **Data Width**: 8 bits or 16 bits
- **Instruction Set**: Supports various operations like addition, subtraction, bitwise operations, multiplication, division, and more.
- **Registers**: Multiple general-purpose registers for computation.
- **Program Counter (PC)**: Keeps track of the next instruction to be executed.
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations based on the provided control signals.
- **Control Unit**: Decodes instructions and generates control signals for the ALU, data registers, and output registers.

# Control Unit Logic Table

## Overview

The `Control_Unit` module in the CPU design is responsible for decoding instructions and generating the appropriate control signals for the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and Output Register. It takes an 8-bit instruction as input and produces various control signals, including:

- `sub` - Subtraction signal for the ALU
- `op_select` - Operation select signal for the ALU
- `write_enable` - Write enable for the Output Register
- `read_enable` - Read enable for the Output Register
- `output_index` - Index for Output Register operations

## Logic Table

The following table describes the control signals generated by the `Control_Unit` based on the 8-bit `instruction` input. The upper 4 bits of the instruction (`instruction[7:4]`) represent the opcode, while the lower 5 bits (`instruction[4:0]`) are used to determine the `output_index` when required.

| `instruction[7:4]` (Opcode) | `instruction[4:0]` (Output Index) | `op_select` | `sub` | `write_enable` | `read_enable` | `output_index` |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|-------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| `0000` (ADD)                | `xxxxx`                           | `000`       | `0`   | `0`            | `0`           | `00000`        |
| `0001` (SUBTRACT)           | `xxxxx`                           | `001`       | `1`   | `0`            | `0`           | `00000`        |
| `0100` (MULTIPLY)           | `xxxxx`                           | `100`       | `0`   | `0`            | `0`           | `00000`        |
| `0101` (DIVIDE)             | `xxxxx`                           | `101`       | `0`   | `0`            | `0`           | `00000`        |
| `0110` (OUTPUT)             | `index`                           | `000`       | `0`   | `1`            | `0`           | `index`        |
| `0111` (OUTPUT_READ)        | `index`                           | `000`       | `0`   | `0`            | `1`           | `index`        |
| Default (others)            | `xxxxx`                           | `000`       | `0`   | `0`            | `0`           | `00000`        |

## TinyTapeout Integration
